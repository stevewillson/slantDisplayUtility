## Motivation

The slant display utility provides structure for reporting. Often, the structure for reporting is conveyed by a written standard and reports do not always follow the specified standard. The slant display utility captures report structure in the code to display a standardized report by taking a simple csv file as input. The report generation can be changed and redistributed as requirements change. This is meant to minimize time spent updating a chart and provide greater situational understanding.
